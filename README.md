Morphine
========

Have you ever needed an API to behave slightly differently to support your framework more naturally? Do you ever feel it would be more efficient to combine multiple APIs into a single feed? That's what morphine is.

Morphine is more than a API proxy. It lets you defined new API endpoints that take in other web services (called remotes), processes them with JavaScript and return a custom payload defined by a handlebars template.

It's still a work in progress...

Install
-------

    $ sudo gem install sass compass
    $ sudo npm install

Run
---

    $ node app.js

Now open a browser, goto http://localhost:3000/ and creat your first API endpoint!
